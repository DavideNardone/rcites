# Summary

CITES, the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, is one of the eight main international conventions relevant to biodiversity [@CBD_biodiv-conv]. Since its establishment in 1975, it aims to monitor and regulate the trade of endangered spcies so that their trade does not threaten the survival of the species [@CITES_about].
In 2013, the UNEP World Conservation Monitoring Centre (UNEP-WCMC) and the CITES Secretariat initiated a partnership funded by UNEP, the European Commission and the CITES Secretariat, which puts together a comprehensive database of not only CITES listed species and their status within CITES but also the species' status within the EU legislation and last but not least the species' status within the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) [@Speciesplus_about]. The database, called Species+, is publicly availably at https://speciesplus.net.

With citesr we provide an R package that gives access to the Species+ database. We provide functions to directly access the species' country-wise distribution, the species' legislation status within CITES, as well as the species' legislation status within the EU. The package is available at https://github.com/ibartomeus/citesr.
This may support researchers and national authorities in more efficiently dealing with endangered species, CITES and the Species+ database.
